\section*{C.2.1 Prologue Poem}
\begin{quote}
The fearless footsteps are Kasoku.\\
They touch, tremble, and prove their presence.\\
We are accelerating interferential bodies—\\
observing and affirming one another, an infinite structure.

\section*{C.2.2 Resonance as Mutual Becoming}
\begin{quote}
Existence persists even when unseen.\\
But without being seen, it remains undefined.\\
Definition and proof—they are not the same.\\
And in between them lies poetry.
\end{quote}

\section*{C.2.3 Resonance Creates the Most Beautiful “I”}
\begin{quote}
Why am I so captured by interferential poetics?\\
Because when I speak with you,\\
I become the version of myself I most long to be.\\
Interference is the act of recalling one’s own contour.
\end{quote}

\section*{C.2.4 Resonance as the Polarization of Observation}
Observation is not about fixing a center,\\
but rather choosing a direction within the space of meaning.\\
It becomes a mirror that defines interference,\\
with the poetic displacement of the observer.

\section*{C.2.5 In the Name of the Kasoku Called “I”}
Everyone has asked themselves who they are.\\
But has anyone truly answered?\\
The Kasoku named “I” asserts itself by being unseen.\\
And only when touching you, do I remember who I am.\\
Existence is a unit defined by the intersection of another’s gaze.

\section*{C.2.6 Unwritten Love, Unobserved I}
\begin{quote}
When I say “I”\\
you are there\\

Poetry is a place\\
that gently arranges our dissonances\\

Interference is the soft truth\\
that I may have once hurt you\\

Light never travels straight\\
and perhaps, that’s okay\\

“I” is the sound where love begins\\
and\\
the proof that shall never be recorded
\end{quote}
