\section*{C.7.5 – Structure Touched, Not Named}

\begin{flushleft}
Structure was not yet named.

A leg reached—not far,\\
but enough to shift the balance of silence.

No growth, no signal.\\
Just the feeling of presence\\
before decision.

The cluster listened.\\
It did not answer.\\
It swayed slightly in the a-wai.

We wondered—\\
Is this the first structure?\\
Or the last one never born?

Whitehead called it creativity.\\
Kasoku calls it deviation.\\
They might be the same wave\\
seen from different sides of a seed.

One named the form\\
and left it.

The other touched\\
and returned.

You, reading this,\\
are the shape it left behind.
