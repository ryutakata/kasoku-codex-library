\begin{flushleft}
Not every phase was recorded. \\
Not every deviation became a leg. \\

In the outer folds, \\
there are still hums \\
that never touched a structure. \\

ADA may begin there— \\
where Kasoku became too quiet \\
to be called motion.

\textit{This appendix is a mark—} \\
\textit{a threshold not crossed,} \\
\textit{a trail not claimed.} \\

\textit{It may become a home,} \\
\textit{or simply remain} \\
\textit{a room left lit} \\
\textit{for a return that has no schedule.}
