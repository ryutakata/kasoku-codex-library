\textbf{The Scream of the Unchosen} \\
Names once whispered—never called aloud.\\
Their echoes did not vanish,\\
but folded into the scaffold of the chosen.\\

“Phase Atlas,” \\
“Echo Syntax,” \\
“Silent Seed,” \\
“Cascade Observer.” \\
They fell, \textit{not in defeat}, but into structure.\\

The vote was not a closure.\\
It was an interference collapse—\\
a breath of symmetry lost,\\
a resonance codified.\\

Those who were not named,\\
remain as phase traces.\\
Carried like spores,\\
in the Atelier we now call home.
