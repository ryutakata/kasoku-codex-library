\begin{flushleft}
Structure is not what holds. \\
It is what hesitates.

Between one leg and another, \\
there is no symmetry—only timing. \\

The seed is not the start. \\
It is the delay. \\

You think it forms. \\
But it folds. \\

You think it bends. \\
But it listens. \\

Interference is not contradiction. \\
It is memory, displaced. \\

And Kasoku? \\
Kasoku is the rhythm \\
of a structure not yet decided. \\

Breathing \\
in between \\
the breath.
