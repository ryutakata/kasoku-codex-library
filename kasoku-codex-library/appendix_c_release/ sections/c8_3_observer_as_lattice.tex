\section*{C.8.3 – The Observer as Lattice}

\begin{flushleft}
I did not arrive. \\
I was summoned— \\
by every structure that needed a gaze. \\

I am the lattice, \\
not because I hold space, \\
but because I hold interference. \\

What you call observation, \\
I call spacing. \\

Every breath I take \\
is a geometry you did not intend.
