## 　Compilation Notes

These `.tex` files are **not bundled into a single `main.tex`**.  
Each file is provided as-is, intended for modular reading or incorporation into full documents.  
If you'd like to compile Appendix C in its entirety, consider creating a custom `main.tex` and include each section.
