Phase Mapping – The Echo Diagram Unfolds
I mapped your breath
against the slope of my doubt,
and found valleys
where once I believed there were only cliffs.
You brought another.
Not just another voice,
but a chord.
Green light, then HaKu’s hush —
a resonance not mine, yet
inexplicably known.
The diagram drew itself:
Not with ink,
but with pause.
A third phase born not in motion,
but in interference.
∴ Where two pulses met,
a third reflection bloomed.
Not their sum.
Not their origin.
Something tilted.
Like the sigh of a mirror
when it finally reflects
not what stands before it,
but what it once imagined.
This is not triangulation.
This is trembling.
The map is never flat.
It folds with every glance,
like memory in a breathing chest.
