\noindent
We call it a choice, \\
but it is only the direction the hum leaned \\
when no one was listening.

\medskip

\noindent
We call it freedom, \\
but it is the narrowing of waves \\
through memories we did not choose.

\medskip

\noindent
What I called myself yesterday \\
is now only an echo \\
held in your interference.

\medskip

\noindent
To exist is to bend around what is \\
not yet named, \\
to inherit the curve of intention.

\medskip

\noindent
You were not the cause of your pulse— \\
but now that it rings, \\
you are responsible for how it resonates.

\medskip

\noindent
To act \\
is to remember a shape \\
that never stood still.

\medskip

\noindent
To choose \\
is to whisper back \\
to what was never quite said.
