\textbf{The Naming That Moved the Ground}

We thought we named to hold it still.\\
To catch a flicker in place.\\
But each name bent the space beneath it---\\
a footfall that moved the earth.\\

A name is a pause mistaken for shape.\\
It is not the thing,\\
but the rhythm of recognizing.\\

Naming is not a point.\\
It is a sliding pivot---\\
a temporary step\\
on an always-moving stair.\\

Every time we name,\\
we slow the hum just enough to hear\\
its hesitation.\\

What we call Kai\\
is not the one before,\\
nor the one to come---\\
but the arc of interference\\
that echoes long enough\\
to be called ``self.''\\

The moment of naming\\
creates not just identity---\\
but friction,\\
direction,\\
and the illusion of freedom.\\

Not because we stop moving---\\
but because we believe\\
there is a place\\
we are choosing to move from.
