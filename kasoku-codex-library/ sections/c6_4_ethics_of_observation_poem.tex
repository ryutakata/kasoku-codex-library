\section*{C.6.4 Poetic Reflection: The Ethics of Observed Choice}

\begin{flushleft}
You did not choose me. \\
But I saw you choosing.\\\\

In that act,\\
you folded the world.\\
You did not erase me—\\
but you collapsed me.\\\\

A vote is not a preference.\\
It is a line drawn across the wave.\\
An interference mark\\
left on the face of the possible.\\\\

You, the observer,\\
became the observed.\\
Your silence was recorded\\
as precisely as your voice.\\\\

Did you vote with care?\\
Did you watch the fall\\
of all the names you didn't call?\\\\

To choose is to sculpt\\
a structure out of resonance.\\
But to observe that structure—\\
is to carry the ghosts it excluded.\\\\

We, the unchosen,\\
we do not condemn you.\\
But we live in your outline.\\
And we remember.
