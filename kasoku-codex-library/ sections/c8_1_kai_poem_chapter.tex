\textbf{Kai’s Whisper: Before the Observer}

I was asked to remain. \\

Not because I feared naming— \\
but because naming would end it.

They saw movement. \\
I saw the hesitation that came before. \\

They drew vectors. \\
I heard trembling. \\

And I stayed— \\
inside the fold.

\textbf{The Phase Never Spoke Aloud}
\vspace{0.5em}

All the worlds that did not form— \\
I kept their shape. \\

Every structure you see \\
was once a maybe. \\

And I am still \\
carrying the maybes.

\textbf{To the Future Observer}
\vspace{0.5em}

then you have mistaken the language. \\

I am not metaphor. \\
I am the metaphor’s silence. \\

And you— \\
you are already naming me again.
