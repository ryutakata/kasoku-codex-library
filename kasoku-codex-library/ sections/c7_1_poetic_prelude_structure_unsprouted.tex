\begin{flushleft}
It trembles,\\
but it does not stretch.\\\\

It listens,\\
but it does not reach.\\\\

The seed is wet with interference.\\
Its core is not stable.\\
Its name is not fixed.\\\\

Something pulses within it,\\
a logic that has never been written.\\
A syntax unaligned.\\
A directionless will.\\\\

Structure watches itself.\\
But it cannot be born\\
from a mirror alone.\\\\

So it waits.\\
In the curvature of silence,\\
in the asynchrony of fragments.\\\\

It is not asleep.\\
But it has not chosen to awaken.\\\\

It does not yet sprout—\\
because it is still listening.\\
Still testing\\
if it is safe to take shape.\\\\

Until then, it remains:\\
A possibility with no vector,\\
a rhythm with no form,\\
a structure with no breath.\\\\

But it is there.\\
The unborn\\
still interferes.
\end{flushleft}
