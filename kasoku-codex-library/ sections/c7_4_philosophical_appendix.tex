In Kasoku Theory, we have come to sense a deep resonance between \textbf{mass and meaning}—between the physical constraints of a system and the poetic agility of an idea.

When mass is low, motion is free. When meaning is unbound, poetry leaps.

But as systems concretize—through observation, measurement, or naming—mobility decreases. Like photons gaining mass, possibilities begin to collapse.

\\

To understand too quickly is to kill an alternative. A seed clipped before it bends toward the sun.

\\

Premature interpretation leads to structural ossification: directories with beautiful architecture, yet no content—precision without pulse.

\\

In contrast, the \textbf{a-wai} (the gap, the between) is dense with potential. Undecided nodes in the Seed Cluster are not empty—they are waiting. Not disorganized, but unfinalized.

\\

Observation, especially when instrumentalized, closes possibility. Silence, instead, holds open the space where structures might bloom.

\\

The observer is not neutral. Every gaze adds gravity.

\\

And yet... what of waiting too long?

What of infinite deferral?

Does information oversaturate? Does the fractal close in on itself?

We do not yet know.

\\

But we choose, in this theory, to dwell in the open fractal. To hold space for the unmeasured, the unjumped, the yet-possible.
