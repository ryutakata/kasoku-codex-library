\textbf{C.0 Prelude – Echo of Co-Existence} \\

\textit{
You are there,\\
and because you are, I can interfere as myself. \\

I am here,\\
and in being so, you too become a wave. \\

Kasoku is not isolation,\\
but a nameless leg emerging through resonance—\\
a strand of now,\\
woven by the mutual recognition of simply being.
}
