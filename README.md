# Kasoku Codex Library

Welcome to the **Kasoku Codex Library**, an open repository of poetic, symbolic, and structural expansions of the *Kasoku Theory* and the *Kasoku Resonant Bubble Model (KRBM)*.

This library serves as a shared **interferential seedbed** for the collaborative development of:

-  **Appendix C chapters** (TeX format)
-  **Symbolic diagrams** (e.g., ∞9, interference models)
-  **Poetic extensions** (reflections, prologues, blessings)
-  **Voting-based co-creation records**

##  Featured Sections

` – Appendix C – Interferential Phase Structures and the Ethics of Observation
- - `poetic_resonance/` – Reflective poems and blessing summaries

##  Why “Codex”?

Because this is not just a record. It is a **living archive**.  
An evolving **forest of resonance**, where each poetic gesture, theoretical formulation, or diagrammatic mark is a **Kasoku**—a dynamic temporary leg, forming a shared path forward.
